# Task Description
Debug and fix inconsistent cache progress display behavior. The progress indicator fails to consistently show up when the cache manager calls `setPhase('preparing', 'Preparing resources...')`. This requires investigating the communication flow between the service worker's cache manager and the display component.

# Project Overview
The project is a service worker implementation for handling resource caching on a PIXILAB Player. Key components include:

- Blocks: Primary content type that can be published on Spots (browser tabs)
- Block Structure:
  - Contains a JSON-adjacent spec file with Block information and resource requirements
  - Can have different types (Media Block, Slideshow Block, etc.)
  - Supports nesting (parent-child relationships)
  - Special "Reference Block" type that links to other Blocks
- Caching System:
  - "Proactive" caching: Explicitly caches specific blocks and referenced blocks recursively
  - "Reactive" caching: Caches resources based on client fetch events
- Key Files:
  - Service worker implementation: "resources/assets/spot/spot-service-worker/src/service-worker.ts"
  - Service worker registration: "Display.ts"
  - Service worker initialization: "StartupManager.ts"
  - Main proactive cache entry: `rebuildBlockCache()` in "cache-manager.ts"

# Original Execution Protocol
```
## 1. Git Branch Creation
1. Create a new task branch from [MAIN BRANCH]:
   ```
   git checkout -b task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
   ```
2. Add the branch name to the [TASK FILE] under "Task Branch."
3. Verify the branch is active:
   ```
   git branch --show-current
   ```

## 2. Task File Creation
1. Create the [TASK FILE], naming it `[TASK_FILE_NAME]_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md` and place it in the `.tasks` directory at the root of the project.
2. The [TASK FILE] should be implemented strictly using the "Task File Template" below.
   a. Start by adding the contents of the "Task File Template" to the [TASK FILE].
   b. Adjust the values of all placeholders based on the "User Input" and placeholder terminal commands.

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, wait for the user to confirm the name and contents of the [TASK FILE] >>>

## 3. Task Analysis
- Examine the [TASK], related code and functionality step-by-step.
- Fill in any details from the analysis in the [TASK FILE].

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, wait for user confirmation that your analysis is satisfactory, if not, iterate on this >>>

## **4. Iterate on the Task**
1. Analyze code context fully before changes.
2. Analyze updates under "Task Progress" in the [TASK FILE] to ensure you don't repeat previous mistakes or unsuccessful changes.
3. Make changes to the codebase as needed.
4. Update any progress under "Task Progress" in the [TASK FILE].
5. For each change:
   - Seek user confirmation on updates.
   - Mark changes as SUCCESSFUL or UNSUCCESSFUL in the log after user confirmation.
   - Optional, when apporopriate (determined appropriate by you), commit code:
     ```
     git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
     git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
     ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, confirm with the user if the changes where successful or not, if not, iterate on this execution step once more >>>

## **5. Task Completion**
1. After user confirmation, and if there are changes to commit:
   - Stage all changes EXCEPT the task file:
     ```
     git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
     ```
   - Commit changes with a concise message:
     ```
     git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
     ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]:: Before continuing, ask the user if the [TASK BRANCH] should be merged into the [MAIN BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8 >>>

## **6. Merge Task Branch**
1. Confirm with the user before merging into [MAIN BRANCH].
2. If approved:
   - Checkout [MAIN BRANCH]:
     ```
     git checkout [MAIN BRANCH]
     ```
   - Merge:
     ```
     git merge task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
     ```
3. Confirm that the merge was successful by running:
   ```
   git log [TASK BRANCH]..[MAIN BRANCH] | cat
   ```

## **7. Delete Task Branch**
1. Ask the user if we should delete the [TASK BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8
2. Delete the [TASK BRANCH]:
   ```
   git branch -d task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
   ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]:: Before continuing, confirm with the user that the [TASK BRANCH] was deleted successfully by looking at `git branch --list | cat` >>>

## **8. Final Review**
1. Look at everything we've done and fill in the "Final Review" in the [TASK FILE].

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]:: Before we are done, give the user the final review >>>
```

# Task Analysis
Initial analysis needed - will investigate:
1. The progress display implementation in Display.ts
2. The service worker's cache manager implementation
3. The communication chain between these components
4. The progress updater mechanism
5. Any potential race conditions or timing issues

# Steps to take
1. ✓ Analyze Display.ts progress display implementation
2. ✓ Examine cache-manager.ts progress update mechanism
3. ✓ Trace the communication path between components
4. ✓ Identify potential issues in the progress update chain
5. ✓ Implement and test fix for state synchronization
6. ✓ Test the fix
7. Hide progress bar element when caching is complete

# Current execution step: 4

# Task Progress
2025-01-16_12:18:07: Task file created, proceeding with analysis.
2025-01-16_12:30:00: Analysis complete. Found issue with state synchronization in cache-manager.ts:
- Progress updates only show when mode is 'proactive' AND state is 'caching'
- State is set to 'caching' before resource mapping, but could change during async operations
- When setPhase('preparing', ...) is called, state might no longer be 'caching'
- Solution: Need to ensure state remains 'caching' during the entire caching process

Proposed fix:
1. Move the state change to 'caching' closer to the actual caching operation
2. Add state guards to prevent state changes during critical operations
3. Add logging to track state changes for debugging

2025-01-16_12:35:00: Implemented fix in cache-manager.ts:
1. Moved setState('caching') closer to the actual caching process
2. Added state guards at critical points:
   - Before preparation phase
   - Before caching phase
   - Before processing remaining items
3. Added debug logging to track state changes
4. The fix ensures the state remains 'caching' during the entire process, which should make progress updates more reliable

2025-01-16_12:40:00: Testing complete - PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL:
1. Logs show correct state transitions:
   - State set to 'caching' before preparation phase
   - No warnings about unexpected state changes (no orange logs)
2. Progress updates are being sent consistently through all phases:
   - Preparing phase (progress: 0)
   - Caching phase with individual file progress
   - Done phase
   - Idle phase
3. However, the progress display element was not showing up immediately

2025-01-16_12:45:00: Additional fix implemented - SUCCESSFUL:
1. Found issue in ProgressDisplay.ts:
   - Element creation was delayed by a show timeout (500ms default)
   - This caused the element to not appear during quick state transitions
2. Fixed by:
   - Removed all show timeouts
   - Made the element visible immediately upon creation
   - Simplified the element creation logic

2025-01-16_12:50:00: Transition improvement added:
1. Modified element creation to support smooth fade-in:
   - Element is created and added to DOM immediately
   - 'visible' class is added in the next animation frame
   - This ensures the CSS transition works properly
2. The progress display now:
   - Shows up immediately when needed
   - Has a smooth fade-in animation
   - Maintains all existing fade-out behavior

2025-01-16_12:55:00: Added inactivity timeout:
1. Added auto-hide functionality:
   - Progress display will fade out after 1.5 seconds of inactivity
   - Only applies when there are no errors and operation isn't complete
   - Resets timer on each progress update
2. Implementation details:
   - Added inactivityTimeout option to ProgressDisplayOptions
   - Default timeout set to 1500ms (1.5 seconds)
   - Added timeout management in update() method
   - Clears timeout when errors occur or operation completes

2025-01-16_13:00:00: Added temporary test code:
1. Added test code in cache-manager.ts to simulate progress update pauses:
   - Splits resource processing into two halves
   - Adds a 2-second pause between halves
   - Clearly marked as temporary with TODO and warning comments
2. This will help test:
   - Progress display fade-out on inactivity
   - Proper reappearance when updates resume
   - Smooth transitions between states

Next steps:
1. Test the progress display behavior with the simulated pauses
2. Verify the inactivity timeout works as expected
3. Remove the temporary test code before merging to production

2025-01-16_13:05:00: Test code removed - SUCCESSFUL:
1. Removed temporary test code from cache-manager.ts:
   - Removed the code that split resources into two halves
   - Removed the artificial 2-second pause
   - Restored original caching process
2. Testing confirmed:
   - Progress display fades out after 1.5 seconds of inactivity
   - Reappears when updates resume
   - Transitions are smooth

2025-01-16_13:10:00: New requirement identified:
1. Progress bar element should be hidden when caching is complete:
   - Currently, the progress bar remains visible under the "Done!" message
   - Need to modify ProgressDisplay.ts to hide the progress bar element
   - Should only show the completion message
2. This will improve the UI by:
   - Reducing visual clutter after completion
   - Making it clear that no more progress updates will come
   - Maintaining a clean interface

Next steps:
1. Modify ProgressDisplay.ts to hide the progress bar element when complete
2. Test the change to ensure proper behavior
3. Update documentation if needed

2025-01-16_13:15:00: Added completion checkmark - TESTING:
1. Added Unicode checkmark to completion message:
   - Using simple checkmark (✓) before "Done!"
   - Will test this version first
   - Can try heavy checkmark (✔) if needed
2. The complete message now shows:
   - "✓ Done!" instead of just "Done!"
   - Progress bar is hidden
   - Clean and clear completion indicator

Next steps:
1. Test the simple checkmark appearance
2. Consider trying heavy checkmark (✔) if needed
3. Update final review once confirmed

2025-01-16_13:20:00: Added spring animation - TESTING:
1. Enhanced progress bar hiding animation:
   - Added spring-like animation using cubic-bezier timing function
   - Duration set to 0.6s for natural spring effect
   - Using height transition instead of display: none
2. Implementation details:
   - Modified spot-progress.less:
     - Added cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275) for spring effect
     - Added height: auto and overflow: hidden
     - Split transitions for better readability
   - Updated ProgressDisplay.ts:
     - Now animates height to 0 instead of using display: none
     - Captures initial height before animation
     - Forces reflow to ensure smooth transition
     - Also collapses margins for clean animation
3. UI improvements:
   - Changed "Done!" to "✓  All Done" with double space
   - Progress bar smoothly collapses with bounce effect
   - Maintains clean look while adding dynamic feel

Next steps:
1. Test the spring animation behavior
2. Verify the progress bar collapse animation
3. Confirm the checkmark and text alignment

2025-01-16_13:25:00: Improved height transitions - TESTING:
1. Enhanced height animations to work for all state changes:
   - Added height transitions to all child elements
   - Using class-based approach instead of inline styles
   - Spring animation applies to all height changes now
2. Implementation details:
   - Modified spot-progress.less:
     - Added universal height transition to all child elements
     - Created explicit .collapsed class for progress bar
     - Ensured transitions work for both height and margin
   - Updated ProgressDisplay.ts:
     - Switched to class-based height transition
     - Removed manual style manipulation
     - Simplified the collapse logic
3. Expected improvements:
   - Smooth transitions for all height changes
   - Consistent spring effect across all animations
   - More maintainable class-based approach

Next steps:
1. Test height transitions in all states
2. Verify spring effect consistency
3. Check for any transition glitches

2025-01-16_13:30:00: Fixed height calculation - TESTING:
1. Improved height calculation for completion state:
   - Now only using the header element's height
   - Container's padding (15px) is handled by CSS
   - This should give a cleaner spring animation
2. Implementation details:
   - Removed padding calculation from handleComplete
   - Using direct offsetHeight from headerText
   - Container's padding remains constant
3. Expected improvements:
   - More accurate final height
   - Cleaner spring animation
   - Better visual balance in completed state

Next steps:
1. Test the height calculation fix
2. Verify spring animation with new height
3. Check padding and spacing in completed state

2025-01-16_13:35:00: Improved spring animation - TESTING:
1. Enhanced spring animation characteristics:
   - Reduced duration from 0.6s to 0.4s for snappier feel
   - Modified cubic-bezier curve for more bounce:
     - From: cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275)
     - To: cubic-bezier(0.11, 0.8, 0.29, 1.48)
   - Reduced opacity fade to 0.2s for cleaner transitions
2. Expected improvements:
   - Faster overall animation
   - More pronounced bounce effect
   - Better synchronized transitions

Next steps:
1. Test the enhanced spring animation
2. Verify the bounce effect feels natural
3. Check if timing feels right

2025-01-17_10:00:00: Visual Design and Animation System Overhaul - SUCCESSFUL:
