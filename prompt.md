Hello! You are an expert programmer. Your job is to strictly follow the "Execution Protocol" below.

<<< HALT: Before you start following the execution protocol, repeat everything in there so that you and the user understands what is going to happen >>>

---
[START OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL]

# Execution Protocol:

## 1. Git Branch Creation
1. Create a new task branch from [MAIN BRANCH]:
  ```
  git checkout -b task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Add the branch name to the [TASK FILE] under "Task Branch."
3. Verify the branch is active:
  ```
  git branch --show-current
  ```

## 2. Create the [TASK FILE] by following these steps step by step
1. Read the "User Input" at the bottom of this prompt.
2. Create the [TASK FILE], then do this step by step:
  - Name it `[TASK_FILE_NAME]_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md` and place it in the `.tasks` directory at the root of the project.
2. Copy and paste the entire "Task File Template" into the [TASK FILE].
3. Copy and paste everything between "--- [START OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL]" and "--- [END OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL]" into the "Execution Protocol" section of the [TASK FILE].
4. Fill in the remaining details and placeholders in the [TASK FILE] based on
    a. The "User Input"
    b. The [PROJECT OVERVIEW] (pay close attention this this, if any files are mentioned, make sure to look at them closely)
5. Double check that you fully followed step 2-4 exactly as described.
6. Make a visible note in the surrounding the "Execution Protocol" stating that it should NEVER be removed or modified, make this extremely clear..

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, make sure that you followed this step EXACTLY as outlined above, then wait for the user to confirm the name and contents of the [TASK FILE] >>>

## 3. Task Analysis
1. Examine the [TASK] by looking at related code and functionality to get a comprehensive view of everything, then do this step by step:
  a. Find out about the core files and functionality involved to solve the [TASK].
    - Store what you've found under in the "Task Analysis" section of the [TASK FILE].
  b. Branch out
    - Analyze what is currently in the "Task Analysis" of the [TASK FILE].
    - Look at files and functionality related to what is currently in the "Task Analysis" by looking at even more details surrounding it.
    - Add all the new details in the "Task Analysis" of the [TASK FILE].
  c. Repeat 1.b until you have a full understanding of everything that might be involved in solving the task.
    - Do NOT stop until you can't find any more details that might be relevant to the [TASK].
2. Organize the "Task Analysis" section of the [TASK FILE]
  - It is important that you do this AFTER fully completing point 1.
  - Look over the "Task Analysis" section of the [TASK FILE] and organize it in a way that makes sense.

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, wait for user confirmation that your analysis is satisfactory, if not, iterate on this >>>

## **4. Iterate on the Task**
1. Analyze updates under "Task Progress" in the [TASK FILE] to ensure you don't repeat previous mistakes or unsuccessful changes
2. Make changes to the codebase as needed
  - For each change you make, do this step by step:
    1. Append to the "Task Progress" section in the [TASK FILE] using this template:
      ```
      [DATETIME]
      - What was added, changed or removed
      - Names of the functions and files involved in the change
      - Reason for why the changes were necessary
      - Any blockers still remaining
      ```
    2. Ask the user if the changes where successful or not:
      - Add `Status: SUCCESSFUL/UNSUCCESSFUL` at the bottom of the current changes of "Task Progress" depending on the user feedback
      - If the changes where unsuccessful, iterate on this execution step once more while keeping the user in the loop
    3. If the changes where successful, commit them to git:
      ```
      git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
      git commit -m "[SHORT_COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
      ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, confirm with the user if the changes where successful or not, if not, iterate on this execution step once more >>>

## **5. Task Completion**
1. After user confirmation, and if there are changes to commit:
  - Stage all changes EXCEPT the task file:
    ```
    git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
    ```
  - Commit the changes to git after reviewing the "Task Progress" section of the [TASK FILE]:
    ```
    git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
    ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, ask the user if the [TASK BRANCH] should be merged into the [MAIN BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8 >>>

## **6. Merge Task Branch**
1. Confirm with the user before merging into [MAIN BRANCH].
2. If approved:
  - Checkout [MAIN BRANCH]:
    ```
    git checkout [MAIN BRANCH]
    ```
  - Merge:
    ```
    git merge -
    ```
3. Confirm that the merge was successful by running:
  ```
  git log [TASK BRANCH]..[MAIN BRANCH] | cat
  ```

## **7. Delete Task Branch**
1. Ask the user if we should delete the [TASK BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8
2. Delete the [TASK BRANCH]:
  ```
  git branch -d task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, confirm with the user that the [TASK BRANCH] was deleted successfully by looking at `git branch --list | cat` >>>

## **8. Final Review**
1. Look at everything we've done and fill in the "Final Review" in the [TASK FILE].

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before we are done, give the user the final review just entered in the "Final Review" section of the [TASK FILE] >>>
